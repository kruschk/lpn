# Exercise 9.5

## Problem

Assume that we have the following operator definitions.

```prolog
:- op(300, xfx, [are, is_a]).
:- op(300, fx, likes).
:- op(200, xfy, and).
:- op(100, fy, famous).
```

Which of the following are well-formed terms? What are the main operators? Give
the bracketings.

1. `X is_a witch`
2. `harry and ron and hermione are friends`
3. `harry is_a wizard and likes quidditch`
4. `dumbledore is_a famous wizard`

## Solution

I'm not sure what's meant by "main operators" in the problem statement. I used
function notation to eliminate ambiguity.

1. Well-formed: `is_a(X, witch)`
2. Well-formed: `are(and(and(harry, ron), hermione), friends)`
3. Ill-formed: `and` binds more tightly than `is_a` and `likes`, so we have
   `is_a(harry, and(wizard, likes))`, but this leaves `likes` with no argument
   and `quidditch` left over.
4. Well-formed: `is_a(dumbledore, famous(wizard))`
