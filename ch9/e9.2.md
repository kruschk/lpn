# Exercise 9.2

## Problem

How does Prolog respond to the following queries?

1. `?- .(a, .(b, .(c, []))) = [a, b, c].`
2. `?- .(a, .(b, .(c, []))) = [a, b|[c]].`
3. `?- .(.(a, []), .(.(b, []), .(.(c, []), []))) = X.`
4. `?- .(a, .(b, .(.(c, []), []))) = [a, b|[c]].`

## Solution

As of SWI-Prolog version 7, `'[|]'` must be used in place of `.` to construct
lists, see https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=ext-lists.

1. `true.`
2. `true.`
3. `X = [[a], [b], [c]].`
4. `false.`
