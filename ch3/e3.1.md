# Exercise 3.1

## Problem

In the text, we discussed the predicate

```prolog
descend(X, Y) :- child(X, Y).
descend(X, Y) :- child(X, Z), descend(Z, Y).
```

Suppose we reformulated this predicate as follows:

```prolog
descend(X, Y) :- child(X, Y).
descend(X, Y) :- descend(X, Z), descend(Z, Y).
```

Would this be problematic?

## Solution

This reformulation is problematic because the second rule is left-recursive,
which will lead to non-termination.
