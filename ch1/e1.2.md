# Exercise 1.2

## Problem

Which of the following sequences of characters are atoms, which are variables,
which are complex terms, and which are not terms at all? Give the functor and
arity of each complex term.

1. `loves(Vincent, mia)`
2. `’loves(Vincent, mia)’`
3. `Butch(boxer)`
4. `boxer(Butch)`
5. `and(big(burger), kahuna(burger))`
6. `and(big(X), kahuna(X))`
7. `_and(big(X), kahuna(X))`
8. `(Butch  kills  Vincent)`
9. `kills(Butch  Vincent)`
10. `kills(Butch, Vincent`

## Solution

1. Complex term `loves/2`
2. Atom
3. None
4. Complex term `boxer/1`
5. Complex terms `and/2`, `big/1`, `kahuna/1`
6. Complex terms `and/2`, `big/1`, `kahuna/1`
7. None
8. None
9. None
10. None (missing closing parenthesis; would be complex term `kills/2` with it)
