# Exercise 1.3

## Problem

How many facts, rules, clauses, and predicates are there in the following
knowledge base? What are the heads of the rules, and what are the goals they
contain?

```prolog
woman(vincent).
woman(mia).
man(jules).
person(X) :- man(X); woman(X).
loves(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).
father(Y, Z) :- man(Y), son(Z, Y).
father(Y, Z) :- man(Y), daughter(Z, Y).
```

## Solution

There are three facts:

1. `woman(vincent).`
2. `woman(mia).`
3. `man(jules).`

There are four rules:

1. `person(X) :- man(X); woman(X).`
2. `loves(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).`
3. `father(Y, Z) :- man(Y), son(Z, Y).`
4. `father(Y, Z) :- man(Y), daughter(Z, Y).`

There are 7 clauses:

1. `woman(vincent).`
2. `woman(mia).`
3. `man(jules).`
4. `person(X) :- man(X); woman(X).`
5. `loves(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).`
6. `father(Y, Z) :- man(Y), son(Z, Y).`
7. `father(Y, Z) :- man(Y), daughter(Z, Y).`

There are five predicates:

1. `woman`
2. `man`
3. `person`
4. `loves`
5. `father`

The heads of the rules are:

1. `person(X)`
2. `loves(X, Y)`
3. `father(Y, Z)`
4. `father(Y, Z)`

Their respective goals are:

1. `person(X)`
  1. `man(X)`
  2. `woman(X)`
2. `loves(X, Y)`
  1. `father(X, Y)`
3. `father(Y, Z)`
  1. `man(Y)`
  2. `son(Z, Y)`
4. `father(Y, Z)`
  1. `man(Y)`
  2. `daughter(Z, Y)`
