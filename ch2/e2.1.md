# Exercise 2.1

## Problem

Which of the following pairs of terms unify? Where relevant, give the variable
instantiations that lead to successful unification.

1. `bread = bread`
2. `’Bread’ = bread`
3. `’bread’ = bread`
4. `Bread = bread`
5. `bread = sausage`
6. `food(bread) = bread`
7. `food(bread) = X`
8. `food(X) = food(bread)`
9. `food(bread,X) = food(Y,sausage)`
10. `food(bread,X,beer) = food(Y,sausage,X)`
11. `food(bread,X,beer) = food(Y,kahuna_burger)`
12. `food(X) = X`
13. `meal(food(bread),drink(beer)) = meal(X,Y)`
14. `meal(food(bread),X) = meal(X,drink(beer))`

## Solution

1. Unifies
2. Doesn't unify
3. Unifies
4. Unifies with `Bread = bread.`
5. Doesn't unify
6. Doesn't unify
7. Unifies with `X = food(bread).`
8. Unifies with `X = bread.`
9. Unifies with `X = sausage, Y = bread.`
10. Doesn't unify
11. Doesn't unify
12. Unifies with the finite representation `X = food(X).` (using SWI-PL, may not
    unify in all implementations)
13. Unifies with `X = food(bread), Y = drink(beer).`
14. Doesn't unify
