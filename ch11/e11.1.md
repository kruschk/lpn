# Exercise 11.1

## Problem

Suppose we start with an empty database. We then give the command:

```prolog
assert(q(a, b)), assertz(q(1, 2)), asserta(q(foo, blug)).
```

What does the database now contain?

We then give the command:

```prolog
retract(q(1, 2)), assertz( (p(X) :- h(X)) ).
```

What does the database now contain?

We then give the command:

```prolog
retractall(q(_, _)).
```

What does the database now contain?

## Solution

After issuing the first command, the database contains the facts:

```prolog
q(foo, blug).
q(a, b).
q(1, 2).
```

The second command removes a fact and adds a rule, yielding:

```prolog
q(foo, blug).
q(a, b).

p(A) :- h(A).
```

The last command eliminates the facts, leaving only the rule.

```prolog
p(A) :- h(A).
```
