# Exercise 5.1

## Problem

How does Prolog respond to the following queries?

1. `X = 3*4.`
2. `X is 3*4.`
3. `4 is X.`
4. `X = Y.`
5. `3 is 1+2.`
6. `3 is +(1, 2).`
7. `3 is X+2.`
8. `X is 1+2.`
9. `1+2 is 1+2.`
10. `is(X, +(1, 2)).`
11. `3+2 = +(3, 2).`
12. `*(7, 5) = 7*5.`
13. `*(7, +(3, 2)) = 7*(3+2).`
14. `*(7, (3+2)) = 7*(3+2).`
15. `7*3+2 = *(7, +(3, 2)).`
16. `*(7, (3+2)) = 7*(+(3, 2)).`

## Solution

1. `X = 3*4.`
2. `X = 12.`
3. `ERROR: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated`
4. `X = Y.`
5. `true.`
6. `true.`
7. `ERROR: Arguments are not sufficiently instantiated`
8. `X = 3.`
9. `false.`
10. `X = 3.`
11. `true.`
12. `true.`
13. `true.`
14. `true.`
15. `false.`
16. `true.`
