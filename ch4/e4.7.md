# Exercise 4.7

## Problem

Draw the search trees for the following three queries:

1. `?- member(a, [c, b, a, y]).`
2. `?- member(x, [a, b, c]).`
3. `?- member(X, [a, b, c]).`

(Search trees were introduced in Chapter 2.)

## Solution

For reference:

```prolog
member(X, [X | _]).
member(X, [_ | T]) :- member(X, T).
```

### Query 1

```prolog
?- member(a, [c | [b, a, y]]).
    ?- member(a, [b | [a, y]]).
        ?- member(a, [a | [y]]).
            true.
```

### Query 2

```prolog
?- member(x, [a | [b, c]]).
    ?- member(x, [b | [c]]).
        ?- member(x, [c | []]).
            ?- member(x, []).
                false.
```

### Query 3

```prolog
?- member(X, [a | [b, c]]).
    X = a.
    ?- member(X, [b | [c]]).
        X = b.
        ?- member(X, [c | []]).
            X = c.
            ?- member(X, []).
                false.
```
